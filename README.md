# Embrace.io Interview

## Key Assumptions:
- No fetch endpoint was provided; the data is simulated.
- The indexes of the crash count match the index of the data point's timestamp.
- Minimal library usage.

## Key Features:
- **Recharts** is used to emulate the Embrace.io stack for data visualization.
- **React Query** was not used since there is no endpoint available to fetch the data.
- **Platform Filter**: Ability to filter the crash data by mobile platforms (iOS and Android).
- **Simulated Loading/Error**: Basic simulated loading state and error handling to provide a better user experience.
